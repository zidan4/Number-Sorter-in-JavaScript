# Number-Sorter-in-JavaScript

freeCodeCamp Pracitice Project.


JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.



In computer science, there are fundamental sorting algorithms that all developers should learn. In this number sorter project, I learnt how to implement and visualize different sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort â€“ all with JavaScript.

This project helped me to understand the fundamental concepts behind these algorithms, and how I can apply them to sort numerical data in web applications.
